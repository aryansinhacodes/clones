# 🧭 Frontend Help Page Clone

A small **frontend clone** of the [Abstract Help Page](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/abstract) — built using just **HTML and CSS**.  
I made this back in **2024**, and I’m uploading it now to **keep track of everything I’ve built** along my frontend journey.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

The design and layout were inspired by the **Abstract** project from **Frontend Practice**.  
It was one of those “learn-by-building” exercises to practice structure, spacing, and clean CSS styling.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

Just

- HTML
- CSS

---

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal was to **recreate the layout and style** as closely as possible, focusing on neat code and visual accuracy with display grid and flex.

---

## ⚠️ Note

- It’s **not responsive** (I can do it now but i am too lazy hehe).
- Originally built in **2024**.
