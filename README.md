# 🧩 Frontend Clones Collection

A collection of all the **frontend clones** I’ve made from **2023 to now**, I built to learn, practice, and have fun with web design and development.

I’m uploading everything here to **keep track of my work and progress** as a frontend developer.  
Some were early experiments, some more refined — all part of my learning journey 🚀

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Most of these projects are inspired by:
- [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects)
- YouTube tutorials
- Real websites I came across and wanted to recreate for fun or learning

Each clone is built from scratch in my own way — sometimes pixel-perfect, sometimes freestyle 😄

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

Depending on the project:
- HTML  
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS
- React.js 

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is simply to **document my growth** as a frontend developer.  
I like keeping my older work visible to see how far I’ve come — and how my code, design sense, and problem-solving have improved over time.

---

## 📅 Timeline

🕓 Projects made between **2023 – 2025**  
📤 Uploaded now to organize everything in one place.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Some clones might **not be responsive**, especially the older ones. And I am super lazy to do so but who know maybe in future?  
- Every folder includes its own **README.md** explaining what it is, when I built it, and what I learned from it.  
- I’ll keep adding the old clones time to time and new clones whenever I make one.
